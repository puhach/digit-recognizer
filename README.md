![Digit Recognizer](./assets/digit_recognizer.png)

This is a simple OpenCV-based Streamlit web application for digit recognition. Once the user scribbles a digit and presses the *Predict* button, the web application reads the scribbled digit as an image, applies the CNN based model, and finally displays the recognized digit with a confidence score as shown in the following image.
